Implement enemy

Enemies: Have a list of objects, some of them objects
After that level, scrolling
https://love2d.org/wiki/Tutorial:Efficient_Tile-based_Scrolling
Tile:
Has info about what to draw, so store pointer to quad in tile file (a few quads, one per type)
Should it also store image? No
Time for delegates: Have simple functions that each type of tile can perform a delegate is stored in tile so that it can be called using the same function name.

Some functions:
-Dissappear: deletes itself when collided with. Add a flag so that tilemap can change to blacnk tile,
 or change to a transparent tile
-life : changes player's lives
Some tiles will have multiple delegates
Also, certain objects shouldnt be considered tiles.
--Tilemap
maybe this needs its own class, because it is going to be updated

Player: Reorganize
Stage: Maybe have a seperate tilemap class
Tiles: Maybe have tiles themselves adjust player position

Note:
Once subclasses are implemented reasonably, and drawing becomes the same, put draw method in superclass
